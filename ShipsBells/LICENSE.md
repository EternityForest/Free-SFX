Ship’s Bells (www.nigelk.org/shipsbells)

“Being a No-Frills Java Program For the Striking Of Bells Of The Watch”.  Displays with text the last bell that was rung (in case you weren’t paying attention when your watch ended!).  Has much nicer bells (IMHO) than I have picked up elsewhere.  Since the author was so kind as to put them in the public domain, I extracted them for use in the application that I ended up using.


From nigelk's site:


The .jar file includes the compiled code, the source code, and the bell noises I put together. I place it all in the public domain (even the bell noises).
